// Given a sorted array of integers and a target average, determine if there is a pair of values in the array where the average of 
// the pair equals the target value. There may be more than 1 pair that matches the average target

// Create an empty function that accepts an array and an interger as a target value

    // Check if the length of the array is 0
    
        // If it is we return false
        
    // Start a pointer at the begining and save it in a variable
 
    // Start a pointer at the end and save it to a variable
   

    // Create a while loop that runs while start is less than end
    
        // We save the value of the first pointer plus the second pointer divided by 2 in a variable giving
        // us the vaerage
      
        // We check if that value is equal to our target variable
      
            // If it is we return true
           
        // Otherwise is the average is less than the target we increment our first pointer
        
        // Otherwise we will decrement our second pointer 
        
    // If we make to the middle of the array and can't find our target average based on adding the sum
    // of the two pointers as we loop through the array we return false
